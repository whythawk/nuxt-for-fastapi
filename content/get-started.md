Accelerate your next FastAPI Base Project Generator frontend development by replacing Vue.js with NuxtJS, an open source framework making web development simple and powerful.

## Build Setup

First deploy FastAPI's [Base Project Generator](https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack-fastapi-postgresql), then replace the entire `frontend` folder with this one, updating the `.env` settings, and `nuxt.config.js`, and `package.json` <i>'frontend'</i> project name with your own.

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

Hot reload does not work in WSL2 (only WSL1, as of 1 April 2021). For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
